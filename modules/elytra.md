### Demonstration

{insert video, possibly make this part of the module layout}

### Details

The elytra module is designed to be as easy to use as possible.

#### BoostControl Mode

The first mode, BoostControl lets you go foreward, left and right with your normal movement keybinds.

The Red/Green bar in the middle of the screen shows if you are being boosted or not. If the bar is red, you are. If it is green, the module has defaulted to vanilla fly.

The special thing about this flight module is that it allows you to go up, and can bypass 2b2t's anticheat while doing it. To go up, hold your jump key while looking bove the green line. The farther above the line you look, the faster you will climb. Please note that you need a bit of speed going into it, and cannot climb vertically. If you don't have any speed and try to aim at a high angle, *you will rubberband, and **possibly be kicked***.

### Settings

 - Mode<br>
    You will want to leave this on BoostControl as Boost is very broken and Fly dosen't work at all.
    - BoostControl<br>
        - Instant Stop - Immidiately stop flying when you stop pressing movement keys
        - Speed - Max speed you can go, measured in blocks per tick.
        - Cutoff - Toggles all cutoff functionality
            - Pitch - Pitch to enable the cutoff at
            - Snap to Pitch - Keybind that snaps your view to the cutoff pitch
            - Auto Boost - Upwards flight
            - Cutoff Render - The Red/Green line on your screen
            - Disable in fluids - Disables the cutoff in lava and water, making it much easier to get out (normal elytra hacks work in fluids)
 - Anti-Stall - Stops you from stalling out. Right click the menu for a pitch control for when it enables.
 - Anti Server-Stall - Some anticheats like NoCheatPlus will completely stop you if you do something it dosent like (Like trying to fly up oo fast). Haven't noticed it much on 2b2t, but it can happen. Disable if you experience glitchy constant rubberbanding.
